> [!WARNING]
> This is a fork of [kitsu-web](https://github.com/hummingbird-me/kitsu-web) with patches to allow the old Ember.js frontend to work with kitsu-tools.
> Don't use it if you want to contribute to the current & soon to be react front-end.
> Use it if you are only interested in the backend development and you want a working frontend to test stuff.
